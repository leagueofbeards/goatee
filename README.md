###A quick-build personal website.    
    
    
Quick and easy setup:    
    
1.  Delete our `config.php.`    
2.	Edit `config_sample.php` and follow the inline comments to guide the process.    
3. Rename `config_sample.php` to `config.php`.    
4. Upload all files to your preferred directory on your hosting plan.    
    
Lots more coming to this.
